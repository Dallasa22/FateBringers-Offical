          <p>FateBringers was founded off the idea that no one would have to play alone again. FateBringers is a Discord based clan. We use Discord to communicate, but we do communicate over each platform as well. We are an active &amp; relatively large clan. Games we play include anything from Destiny 1 &amp; 2, Call of Duty, PUBG &amp; Fortnite, etc. We have members all across these games and across different platforms. </p>
          <p>"Growing up, I didnâ€™t have very many friends to play games with via Xbox, PS4, PC. So I decided I had enough, and created FateBringers. FateBringers isn't just a clan, We are a family of great individuals, who are ready to grow into something greater. Our clan is aimed towards those who feel they need a gaming family. With that, I say welcome home!" ~ Dallas A. [Founder]</p>
